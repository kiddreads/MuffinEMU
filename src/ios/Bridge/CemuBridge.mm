// event, so the signal handler below is a supplement, not the primary diagnostic.

// constructor rather than from Swift/App init, in case there's also a CPU-side

    // that only ever contains user data, so LoadSharedData() logged "Shared font
    // CafeCn.ttf is not present" and installed a stub region, and every per-title
    // game profile silently resolved to the default - including the position
    // invariance MetalRenderer::ResolvePositionInvariance() reads at Initialize().
    // Those files now ship in the app bundle (ci/copy-bundle-data.sh, wired up as a
    // postBuildScript in src/ios/project.yml), so point the data path there.
    //
    // The bundle is read-only, which is fine: SetPaths() only TestWriteAccess()es
    // userDataPath, configPath and cachePath. GameProfile::Save() likewise writes to
    // GetConfigPath("gameProfiles"), not here.
    //
    // The data root is a "CemuData" SUBDIRECTORY of the bundle, not the bundle
    // itself, and that indirection is load-bearing. GetDataPath()'s callers hardcode
    // a "resources/" prefix, so making the bundle the data root put a directory
    // literally named `resources` at the top level of Cemu.app - and iOS filesystems
    // are case-insensitive, so CFBundle's probe for the reserved `Resources`
    // directory matched it. That reclassifies the bundle from a flat one (Info.plist
    // at the top level, which is where ours is) into a Resources-style one (Info.plist
    // expected inside), and CFBundle then reads no Info.plist at all: -bundleIdentifier,
    // -infoDictionary[@"CFBundleExecutable"] and -executablePath all come back nil for
    // a bundle whose files are every one of them present and intact.
    //
    // That is what broke v1.14 and v1.15 under LiveContainer. LiveContainer reads
    // Info.plist directly off disk to install, so installs succeeded; then
    // LCBootstrap.m asked NSBundle for -executablePath at launch, got nil, and
    // reported "App's executable path not found. Please try force re-signing or
    // reinstalling this app." Nothing was missing and nothing was being deleted.
    // v1.13 worked only because its bundle was flat and had no such directory.
    // Confirmed by isolation against a real CFBundle: the v1.13 bundle plus one empty
    // directory named `resources` reproduces it exactly, v1.13 plus `gameProfiles`
    // does not, and the v1.15 bundle with that one directory renamed resolves cleanly.
    //
    // Nesting keeps Cemu's own relative layout (CemuData/resources/sharedFonts,
    // CemuData/gameProfiles) exactly as GetDataPath()'s callers expect, while leaving
    // the top level of the bundle with no name CFBundle reserves. ci/verify-ipa.sh
