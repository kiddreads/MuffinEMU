// The app crashed on the very first real on-device launch, before any game was even

// Root cause turned out to be a GPU/AGX driver panic (BIF0 page fault), which is NOT
// delivered to the app as a normal POSIX signal - it's a hardware/firmware-level
// event, so the signal handler below is a supplement, not the primary diagnostic.
// The checkpoint trail is what actually matters here: written via synchronous
// write() calls that hit disk immediately, so even an abrupt un-catchable
// termination leaves a record of exactly how far execution got. The signal handler
// is installed via a high-priority (101 - earliest allowed for user code) C++
// constructor rather than from Swift/App init, in case there's also a CPU-side
// crash in one of the ~90 linked Cemu engine libraries' static initializers, which
// run before main() - too early for a Swift-installed handler to catch. Writes to
// Documents/CemuCrashLog.txt - already Finder/Files-visible thanks to
// UIFileSharingEnabled - so it's unambiguously "the" Cemu crash, not some unrelated
// system daemon's diagnostic (which is what happened hunting through iOS's own

// BW-112: ask the kernel whether this process actually gets executable memory,
// instead of assuming it does not.
//
// Every iOS build up to now called LaunchSettings::SetForceInterpreter(true)
// unconditionally a few lines below. That was a bring-up hedge from a point where
// nobody knew whether a sideloaded process can obtain genuine PROT_EXEC pages from
// mmap - which is exactly what Xbyak_aarch64::MmapAllocator::alloc() needs - or
// whether LiveContainer's JIT trick only re-flags pages that were already mapped.
// The question was never answered, only routed around, and the hedge kept shipping.
// Worse, PPCRecompiler.cpp:696 prints "(forced, overriding Multi-core recompiler)"
// whenever that flag is set however it was set, so the launcher named a
// --force-interpreter argument that nobody ever passed. That is why turning JIT on
// in the UI looked like the app lying about it. Answer it at runtime.
//
// The first version of this answered the question by executing the page. That is not
// a probe, it is a coin flip with the process as the stake: on iOS a code-signing
// violation arrives as an uncatchable SIGKILL, so "can we execute our own memory"
// cannot be asked by executing our own memory - a "no" is indistinguishable from the
// app dying. The sentinel meant to make that failure sticky only ever got written on
// the launch that died, and the device log ends exactly there, on "Entering stage 2 -
// calling into the page", on every single launch.
//
// So nothing is executed here, and nothing ever will be. That rule stands.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THIRD ROUND, and this is the round that matters, because the probe as written could
// not have returned true on any iPhone or iPad ever made.
//
// It required mmap(PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC, ..., MAP_JIT). That is the
// x86_64 shape of the API, where a MAP_JIT region really is an ordinary RWX mapping
// and W^X is advisory. It is not how an APRR core works. On A12 and later (and on
// every Apple silicon Mac) a MAP_JIT region is mapped once and then governed by a
// PER-THREAD hardware permission register: pthread_jit_write_protect_np(0) makes the
// region writable for the calling thread, pthread_jit_write_protect_np(1) makes it
// executable for the calling thread, and one thread never has both at once. Asking
// mmap for PROT_EXEC on such a region asks for a permission the region does not
// express that way, and the kernel answers EINVAL. EINVAL is errno 22, which is
// precisely, literally, what every device log this project has ever collected says:
//
//     JIT check: mmap(MAP_JIT, executable at map time) refused (errno 22) -> interpreter
//
// Not "this device is locked down". Not "sideloading does not grant JIT". The probe
// asked the wrong question, got the correct answer to that wrong question, and the
// emulator has been interpreter-only ever since - on every device, for every user,
// including the session where a retail game ran at a playable framerate.
//
// So the probe now tests the mechanism iOS arm64 actually implements, in the order a
// real JIT allocator uses it:
//
//   1. mmap(PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON | MAP_JIT). MAP_JIT stays a
//      HARD requirement and always will. A plain anonymous mapping promoted RW -> RX by
//      mprotect() passes every syscall it makes and then takes SIGBUS on the first
//      instruction fetch, because code-signing enforcement never saw a JIT region. That
//      is not a hypothesis, it is the v1.37 crash: CS_DEBUGGED set, mprotect(R+X)
//      returning 0, "Recompiler initialized", then signal 10 the first time anything
//      entered generated code. A promoted mapping is never accepted here.
//
//   2. vm_region_64(VM_REGION_BASIC_INFO_64) on the page that came back, requiring
//      max_protection to carry VM_PROT_EXECUTE. max_protection is what a region could
//      EVER become, as against what it is right now, and it is the only way to ask that
//      question without trying it. A MAP_JIT region whose max_protection comes back
//      without execute is the kernel saying, in the one way it can short of failing the
//      call, that this region will never run code. Refusing on that is cheap.
//
//   3. dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "pthread_jit_write_protect_np"). Resolved rather than called
//      directly because <pthread.h> declares it
//          __API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0)) __API_UNAVAILABLE(ios, tvos, watchos, driverkit)
//      so naming it from an iOS target does not compile, even though libsystem_pthread on
//      a modern arm64 iOS carries the symbol and drives the same APRR hardware. dlsym
//      asks the runtime what is there instead of asking the SDK what Apple documents.
//
//   4. Open the write switch, store one word through the mapping, read it back, close the
//      switch. This is the only step that touches the memory, and it is a WRITE, never a
//      jump. It ends with the switch closed, the state every thread starts in, so the
//      calling thread is left exactly as it was found.
//
// A9X and other pre-APRR targets are not an afterthought here. On a core with no W^X
// switch there is nothing to open: pthread_jit_write_protect_supported_np() reports
// false, the MAP_JIT region is plainly writable, and calling the toggle would be
// meaningless rather than harmless. So step 4 asks first and only opens a switch that is
// actually in force. "The switch is missing" is a refusal only when the runtime also says
// the switch is required.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NO LONGER A GATE: CS_DEBUGGED.
//
// It is still read and reported in every outcome, because when MAP_JIT is refused it is
// almost always the reason and it is the one thing the user can act on ("launch through
// StikJIT"). But it is a proxy for "the kernel will not kill us at instruction fetch",
// and steps 1-4 test that same permission directly, through the exact mechanism the
// allocator uses. Keeping a proxy as the gate would refuse a build that genuinely carries
// dynamic-codesigning - src/ios/Cemu.entitlements now declares exactly that, and an
// entitled process has MAP_JIT without ever being debugged - which is the same class of
// mistake as demanding PROT_EXEC: testing the stand-in instead of the thing.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SENTINEL, AND THE LIFECYCLE BUG THIS ROUND EXISTS TO KILL.
//
// The crash sentinel is a file written before generated code can run and deleted once
// generated code has run and returned alive. If the app dies in between, the next launch
// finds it and refuses the recompiler. That design is sound.
//
// What is not sound, and what made the JIT toggle permanently inert twice, is arming it
// for a launch that was never going to run the recompiler at all. Nothing then clears it,
// and the next launch of the same build refuses JIT citing a crash that never happened.
// Two ways that has happened, both of which this file now structurally cannot do:
//
//   PATH 1 - armed from the Settings toggle. cemu_bridge_set_recompiler_enabled() is
//     called on EVERY FLICK of the switch in SettingsView.swift, including by someone who
//     never launches a game afterwards. So that function writes NOTHING to disk and runs
//     no probe. It is a preference write and nothing else.
//
//   PATH 2 - armed at engine init, for a boot where PPCRecompiler_init() then declined
//     for its own reasons and returned normally. It has four such returns (force-disabled
//     by the user's own toggle, SinglecoreInterpreter configured, the ForceInterpreter /
//     ForceMultiCoreInterpreter launch flags, and the AArch64 interface functions failing
//     to land in executable memory) and only the last of them looks like a failure. So
//     ios_jit_is_permitted() does not arm anything either. It answers a question.
//
// Arming happens in exactly one place: ios_jit_arm_for_launch(), called immediately before
// CafeSystem::LaunchForegroundTitle(), after the prepare step that runs PPCRecompiler_init()
// has returned, and only when ppcRecompilerEnabled - the recompiler's own final answer
// about itself - is true. At that moment the next thing that can happen is a title thread
// entering generated code, and nothing between there and that entry can change the answer.
// Every exit from the armed state is walked, one at a time, in that function's comment.
//
// One more, separate guard: step 4 is the only part of the probe that can kill the
// process. Apple documents pthread_jit_write_protect_np() as terminating a caller that
// lacks JIT permission, and while reaching it requires MAP_JIT to have already succeeded,
// this project has been killed by its own probe once before and the device log ended on
// the line that did it. So that one step is bracketed by its own small sentinel, written
// immediately before and removed immediately after, synchronously, on one thread, with
// nothing asynchronous in between - which is what makes its lifecycle airtight in a way
// the boot sentinel's could never be. If it is found at startup, the probe that wrote it
// did not come back, and this build declines to take that step again. It carries the build
// id for the same reason the crash sentinel does: shipping a fix has to be able to clear it.
//
// The caveat that must not get lost: the AArch64 recompiler has only ever been proven
// to COMPILE for iOS. It has never executed one instruction on device. A passing check
// makes the JIT testable. It does not make it correct and it does not make it fast.
