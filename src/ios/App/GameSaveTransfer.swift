/// Moving a game's in-game save in and out of MuffinEMU.
///
/// This is the save the GAME writes - your progress, your file slots - not a save state.
/// Save states are MuffinEMU's own snapshot of the whole machine and mean nothing to any
/// other emulator; this is the Wii U's own save data, in the Wii U's own layout, which is
/// why it can travel to desktop Cemu, to another iOS emulator, or onto real hardware.
///
/// # Where it lives
///
/// `CafeSystem.cpp:201` is the authority:
///
///     ActiveSettings::GetMlcPath("usr/save/{:08X}/{:08X}/user/", titleId >> 32, titleId & 0xFFFFFFFF)
///
/// so a title's save data is `mlc/usr/save/<HIGH>/<LOW>/`, holding `user/` (the accounts,
/// plus `common/`) and usually `meta/`. That whole title folder is what gets exported: it
/// is the unit every other Cemu install expects, and exporting only `user/` produces
/// something the other end has to know how to re-nest.
///
/// The case is worth a word. That format string is uppercase, but `iosu_acp.cpp` scans
/// with lowercase `%08x`. Cemu gets away with the inconsistency because it ships on
/// case-insensitive filesystems, and iOS is one - but a folder arriving from a
/// case-SENSITIVE Linux or Windows setup can be spelled either way, so every lookup here
/// resolves case-insensitively instead of trusting the spelling.
