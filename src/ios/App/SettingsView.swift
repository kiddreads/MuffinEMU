/// Settings/. This Form used to be one ~700-line expression, and Swift's type
/// checker gave up on it outright: "the compiler is unable to type-check this
/// expression in reasonable time". SwiftUI's generic ViewBuilder nesting makes
/// inference cost grow sharply with how much is inlined in one expression, and it
/// grew again once Graphics picked up three new controls - so the fix here isn't
/// "fewer siblings in a bigger expression" (the settingsGroup1..4 split this
/// replaces), it's siblings that are themselves concrete named types. A Section
/// literal with a dozen modifiers costs the type checker far more to infer than one
/// call to a struct whose own body already type-checked on its own.
///
/// ViewBuilder's buildBlock only goes up to 10 children per block, though, and
/// there are more than 10 sections - hence formTop/formBottom below rather than one
