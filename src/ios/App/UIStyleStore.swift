/// Two switches over how the app is *styled*, with no effect on what it can do.
///
/// Both exist because UI work landed on 2026-09-15 that not everyone wants. Rather than
/// argue about taste in a changelog, the styling layer became switchable - every control,
/// row, section and setting stays exactly where it is and does exactly what it did, only
/// the presentation changes.
///
/// # Why this is implementable at all
///
/// Because that UI work was centralised into shared components rather than sprinkled
/// through call sites. Twenty-four Settings sections call `SettingsSectionHeader`, rows go
/// through `SettingsRow` and `DestructiveSettingsLabel`, screens go through `ScreenChrome`,
/// and depth/type/spacing all resolve through `MuffinTheme`. Flipping a flag inside those
/// components changes the whole app without touching a single call site.
///
/// # What Classic UI honestly is, and is not
///
/// It restores the **styling** the app had at v2.0 - flat cards with one soft shadow,
/// plain text section headers, system-font rows, no chips or badges or lighting passes.
///
/// It is NOT a v2.0 build, and cannot be. v2.0's view code does not contain Low Power
/// Mode, cover-art override, graphic packs, emulated devices, accounts, or anything else
/// added since; mounting those old views would delete features, which is the opposite of
/// what was asked for. So this reverts the look and keeps the app. Expect "the classic
/// styling", not a pixel-exact v2.0 screenshot.
///
/// # Why Liquid Glass gets its own switch
///
/// It is a strictly smaller ask than Classic UI: keep the new layout and typography, drop
/// only the translucent/refractive material. Folding the two together would force someone
/// who dislikes glass to also give up the new Settings organisation, which is not what
/// they asked for. Classic UI implies glass-off; glass-off does not imply Classic UI.
///
/// As of today there is no `.glassEffect` left in the tree - the iOS 26 Liquid Glass
/// adoption was reverted on 2026-09-15 after Brandon reported it "makes the ui feel clunky
/// and weird". So this switch has two jobs: it turns off the *glass-adjacent* material
/// that remains (the sheen and lighting passes in MuffinTheme's newer layer, which is what
/// still reads as glassy), and it is the permanent gate any future `glassEffect` must sit
/// behind, so real Liquid Glass can never come back ungated.
